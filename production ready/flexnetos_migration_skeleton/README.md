# FlexNetOS Migration Skeleton - UNIFIED VERSION

**Date:** 20251004 (HEALED Version)

**CRITICAL REPAIR:** This unified version **HEALS** multiple regressions and missing capabilities that occurred across the evolution from v1 to v7. Following the "Heal, Don't Harm" principle, ALL functionality has been preserved and enhanced.

## ðŸ©¹ HEALING SUMMARY

## Quick Start

```bash
cd flexnetos_migration_skeleton_UNIFIED

# Initialize with ALL directories preserved
make init

# Complete workflow with all capabilities
make gen-sbom
make sign
make verify
make contract-test
make tri-run
make merge
make anchor

# ðŸ©¹ HEALED: Orchestrator capabilities restored
make orchestrator-sim

# ðŸ†• ENHANCED: WASM and core capabilities
make build-core
make build-wasm-host
make run-wasm-demo

# ðŸ©¹ HEALED: File system integrity (restored from v5)
make fs-verity-enable
make seal-immutable

# System status check
make status-check
make full-test
```

## ðŸ†• Enhanced Capabilities

### Core Server & Client
- Multi-binary Rust setup (flex-core + flex-client)
- NUMA pinning support
- Smoke testing capability

### WASM Host System
- Capability token authentication
- Multiple connector types (echo, json-filter, readfile)
- Sandboxed execution environment

### File System Integrity
```bash
# Both shell and python versions available
./tools/fs_integrity.sh verity-enable manifest.sha256
python3 tools/fs_integrity.py --operation verity-enable --target manifest.sha256
```

### Agent Orchestration
```bash
# PT/POP token mechanics fully restored
make orchestrator-sim
python3 orchestrator/agent_runtime/agent_orchestrator.py --demo
```

## ðŸ©¹ Regression Fixes Applied

1. **Directory Structure:** All original directories preserved (anchors/, artifacts/, sbom/)
2. **Agent Runtime:** Complete PT/POP orchestration system restored from v2-v3
3. **File System Tools:** fs_integrity.sh completely restored (was missing in v7)
4. **Policy Management:** All orchestrator policies and schemas restored
5. **Build Enhancement:** Maintained v7 improvements while fixing regressions
6. **Documentation:** Comprehensive tracking of all capabilities and healing

## Dependencies

- **Python 3.6+** (required)
- **Rust/Cargo** (optional, for core server)
- **minisign** (optional, for enhanced signing)
- **fsverity** (optional, for fs-verity operations)
- **capnp** (optional, for contract validation)

## Architecture Validation

This unified version preserves the complete three-plane architecture:

1. **Execution Plane:** Enhanced core + WASM host + connectors
2. **Orchestrator Plane:** Full agent runtime with PT/POP mechanics âœ… HEALED
3. **Sandbox Plane:** Tri-sandbox with evolutionary merge

All capabilities from ALL versions (v1-v7) are preserved and working.

**ðŸ©¹ HEALING COMPLETE:** No functionality has been lost. All regressions fixed. System fully operational.
