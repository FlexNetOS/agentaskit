7-Phase Workflow SOP: Phase 1 (User Request Ingestion) → Phase 2 (928-Agent Selection & Task Assignment) → Phase 3 (Task Execution with PT/POP system) → Phase 4 (Communication & Coordination) → Phase 5 (NOA Triple-Verification A/B/C) → Phase 6 (Model D Evolutionary Merge & Output Processing) → Phase 7 (Post-Delivery Operations). Performance gates: <100ms agent startup, <50ms response time, 10K+ tasks/sec, 100K+ messages/sec, 99.99% availability. Security requirements: capability tokens, encryption, fs-verity integrity. All phases require triple verification with evidence ledger and SHA-256 hashes.
