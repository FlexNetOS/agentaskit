# Task Execution Framework Correction

## User Query Analysis
**Original Request:** "Are the any dublicate, unused, or files with no value add. Make production ready. Cross-refrence archives for anthing missing or overlooked e.g. (.todo and .sop at project root) (hooks, sandboxes, sbom...)"

## Error Acknowledgment
I failed to use the task execution framework as specified in the project specifications. I should have:

1. **Used the 4D Method Task Processing** - Deconstruct → Diagnose → Develop → Deliver
2. **Processed through ChatRequest** → EnhancedWorkflowProcessor
3. **Updated .todo file** with proper task subjects
4. **Read .sop file** for standard operating procedures
5. **Generated deliverables** with target locations

## Correct Implementation
Let me now process this request properly through the task execution framework.
