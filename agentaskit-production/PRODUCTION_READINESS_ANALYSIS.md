- **Enhanced:** Unified component building, comprehensive status checking

### 🗑️ **Duplicates & Unused Files Removed**

#### Duplicates Identified & Cleaned:
1. **Empty TODO file** in `docs/agentaskit.todo` (0 bytes) - ❌ REMOVED
2. **Empty directories** in `docs/` - ❌ REMOVED (`api/`, `architecture/`, `deployment/`, `user/`)
3. **Placeholder directories** - Already removed in previous unification

#### Files with No Value-Add:
- No unused files found - all components serve production purposes
- All tools in `unified_tools/` are referenced in production workflows

### 🔧 **Production Infrastructure Complete**

## Archive Cross-Reference Analysis

### ✅ **All Critical Components Recovered**

#### From `archive/old_versions/agentaskitv2/agentaskit/v4/`:
- **Control Files:** `.todo`, `.sop` - Production workflow definitions
- **Quality Gates:** `hooks/pre-push` - Strict verification before commits
- **Tri-Sandbox:** Complete parallel execution environment
- **Tools Integration:** All 17 tools validated against archive versions

#### Missing Components Analysis:
**❌ Previously Missing:**
1. Root-level `.todo` and `.sop` files (production control)
2. Git hooks for quality gating (CI/CD integration)
3. Tri-sandbox execution environment (triple verification)
4. SBOM/signing/verification infrastructure (security)
5. Merkle anchoring system (release integrity)

**✅ Now Present:**
