# AgentAsKit Complete System Unification Plan

**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Status:** ACTIVE UNIFICATION  
**Goal:** Complete unified system without separate NOA/FlexNetOS folders  

## ðŸŽ¯ Unification Strategy

### Current Issues Identified:
1. **Artificial Separation**: NOA and FlexNetOS folders create unnecessary complexity
2. **Empty Directories**: anchors/, artifacts/, sbom/, multiple empty script dirs
3. **Duplicate Files**: Multiple versions of same tools across archive
4. **Scattered Documentation**: .md files at root need organization
5. **Missing Structure**: No logs/, audit/, hash/ folders for operations

### Unified Structure Target:
```
agentaskit-production/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/                    # Main system (existing)
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/                  # Common components (existing)
â”œâ”€â”€ orchestration/           # Merged NOA + FlexNetOS orchestration
â”œâ”€â”€ execution/               # Runtime and WASM (from FlexNetOS)
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/                  # Agent management (from NOA)
â”œâ”€â”€ tools/                   # Unified tool collection
â”œâ”€â”€ configs/                 # All configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/                 # Operational scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                    # All documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                   # All tests
â”œâ”€â”€ logs/                    # System logs (NEW)
â”œâ”€â”€ audit/                   # Audit reports (NEW)
â””â”€â”€ hash/                    # Hash verification (NEW)
```

## ðŸ”„ Phase 1: Merge NOA and FlexNetOS

### Actions:
1. Merge orchestration capabilities
2. Consolidate agent management
3. Unify execution environment
4. Combine tool collections
5. Remove empty directories
6. Organize documentation

### Benefits:
- Single source of truth
- Eliminated redundancy  
- Cleaner architecture
- Better maintainability
