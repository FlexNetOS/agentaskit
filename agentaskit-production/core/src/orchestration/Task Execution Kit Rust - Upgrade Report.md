# Task Execution Kit Rust - Upgrade Report

**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Author:** Manus AI

## 1. Introduction

This report details the successful upgrade of the `task_exec_kit_rust` repository. The primary goal was to enhance the Rust implementation by cross-analyzing and integrating the proven functionality of its Python counterpart, `task_exec_kit`. The upgrade focused on achieving feature parity, improving performance and safety, and establishing a robust, extensible architecture for future development.

This document summarizes the new architecture, key features implemented, testing and validation results, and provides guidance for using the new system.

## 2. Architecture and Design

The upgraded architecture is designed to be modular, performant, and secure, combining the strengths of both the original Rust and Python implementations. The core principle was **"Heal, Don't Harm,"** ensuring that the existing effect-based security model was preserved while integrating a more powerful agent-based execution model.

### Key Architectural Changes:

- **Unified Workspace:** The Cargo workspace was reorganized to include new crates for planning, agent management, and a powerful CLI, providing a clear separation of concerns.
- **Agent-Based Execution:** A new agent system, inspired by the Python version, was introduced. It includes a central `AgentRegistry` and a flexible `Agent` trait that allows for easy extension.
- **Parallel Execution Engine:** A `ParallelExecutor` was implemented using Tokio to run tasks concurrently, significantly improving performance for I/O-bound and parallelizable workloads.
- **SoT Planner:** A dedicated `noa-planner` crate was created to parse `sot.md` files, converting them into structured `ExecutionPlan` objects. This replaces ad-hoc parsing and provides a solid foundation for more advanced planning capabilities.
- **Enhanced ABI:** The `noa-abi` crate was extended to include data structures for tasks, queues, execution plans, and results, ensuring type-safe communication between all components of the system.

For a complete overview of the new design, please refer to the [UPGRADE_ARCHITECTURE.md](UPGRADE_ARCHITECTURE.md) document.

## 3. Implemented Features

The following key features from `task_exec_kit` have been successfully ported and integrated into the Rust implementation:

| Feature | Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SoT Parsing** | ✅ Complete | The `SotParser` can successfully parse `sot.md` files to extract execution queues and tasks. |
| **Execution Planning** | ✅ Complete | The `plan` command generates a structured JSON `ExecutionPlan` from an `sot.md` file. |
| **Agent System** | ✅ Complete | A trait-based agent system with a `NoOpAgent` and a `ShellAgent` has been implemented. |
| **Parallel Execution** | ✅ Complete | The `run` command uses a `ParallelExecutor` to execute tasks concurrently with a configurable number of workers. |
| **Shell Command Execution** | ✅ Complete | The `ShellAgent` can safely execute shell commands defined in `hooks.json`, with support for `dry-run` mode. |
| **Configuration Management** | ✅ Complete | The CLI now loads `manifest.json` and `hooks.json` from a `config/` directory, mirroring the Python version's behavior. |
| **Evidence Logging** | ✅ Complete | Both `NoOpAgent` and `ShellAgent` produce evidence files in a structured `runs/` directory, including logs and command outputs. |
| **CLI Interface** | ✅ Complete | A new CLI powered by `clap` provides `plan` and `run` subcommands with feature parity to the Python CLI. |

## 4. Testing and Validation

A comprehensive suite of tests was developed to ensure the correctness and robustness of the upgraded implementation. The validation process included:

- **Unit Tests:** Each new crate (`noa-planner`, `noa-agents`, `noa-kernel`, `task-exec-kit`) includes a suite of unit tests covering its core functionality.
- **Integration Tests:** The `cargo test --workspace` command was used to run all tests and verify the integration between crates.
- **End-to-End Testing:** The CLI was tested end-to-end by:
    1.  Generating an execution plan from the provided `sot.md` file.
    2.  Executing the generated plan in `dry-run` mode.
    3.  Verifying the contents of the generated run summary and evidence logs.

All tests passed successfully, and the system has been validated to be stable and performant. The full test suite can be run with `cargo test --workspace`.

## 5. How to Use the Upgraded Kit

The upgraded `task_exec_kit_rust` is now a powerful, self-contained tool for task automation. Here’s how to get started:

### 1. Build the CLI

First, build the release binary:

```bash
cargo build --release --bin task-exec-kit
```

### 2. Generate an Execution Plan

Use the `plan` command to parse your `sot.md` file and create a plan:

```bash
./target/release/task-exec-kit plan --sot sot.md --out plan.json
```

This will create a `plan.json` file in the root of the repository.

### 3. Execute the Plan

Use the `run` command to execute the generated plan. You can control parallelism with the `--max-workers` flag and prevent shell command execution with `--dry-run`.

```bash
# Dry run with 4 workers (won't execute shell commands)
./target/release/task-exec-kit run --plan plan.json --dry-run --max-workers 4

# Live run with 8 workers
./target/release/task-exec-kit run --plan plan.json --max-workers 8
```

Execution results, including a detailed `run.json` summary and logs for each task, will be saved to a timestamped directory inside `runs/`.

### 4. Configure Hooks

To execute shell commands, define them in `config/hooks.json`. The structure is identical to the Python version:

```json
{
  "TASK-001": {
    "commands": [
      { "cmd": ["echo", "Executing TASK-001"], "cwd": "/tmp" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 6. Conclusion and Next Steps

This upgrade successfully brings the `task_exec_kit_rust` to feature parity with its Python counterpart, while also introducing significant improvements in performance, safety, and maintainability. The new architecture provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.

### Future Work:

- **Effect-Agent Bridge:** Fully integrate the existing effect system with the new agent model to provide fine-grained, capability-based security for all agents.
- **Advanced Scheduling:** Implement more sophisticated task scheduling and dependency management within the `ParallelExecutor`.
- **Enhanced Configuration:** Add support for more complex configuration scenarios, including dynamic agent loading and remote configuration sources.

This upgraded tool is now ready for integration into the broader NOA ecosystem.
