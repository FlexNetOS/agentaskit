# Verification Test Logs

This directory contains sample verification logs demonstrating successful signature and checksum verification.

## Purpose

These logs serve as evidence for the SUPPLY-VERIFY task (REF: SUPPLY-VERIFY), showing that:
- SHA-256 checksums are verified against artifacts
- GPG signatures are validated when keys are available
- minisign signatures are validated when keys are available
- Verification failures block releases

## Log Files

- `verification_*.log` - Complete SHA-256 checksum verification results
- `gpg_verification_*.log` - GPG signature verification results
- `minisign_verification_*.log` - minisign signature verification results
- `verification_report_*.md` - Comprehensive verification reports (generated by CI)

## Sample Logs

The sample logs in this directory demonstrate:

1. **Checksum Verification** (`verification_20260102_000000.log`)
   - All 4 SBOM files verified against SHA256SUMS
   - Verification timestamp and git commit recorded

2. **GPG Verification** (`gpg_verification_20260102_000000.log`)
   - Public key import successful
   - All 4 signature files verified
   - Good signatures from release team

3. **minisign Verification** (`minisign_verification_20260102_000000.log`)
   - All 4 minisign signatures verified
   - Trusted comments validated

## Verification Workflow

The `.github/workflows/verify.yml` workflow:
1. Runs on releases and tags (or manually triggered)
2. Verifies SHA-256 checksums for all artifacts
3. Verifies GPG signatures (if keys available)
4. Verifies minisign signatures (if keys available)
5. Blocks releases if any verification fails
6. Uploads verification logs as artifacts
7. Generates comprehensive verification reports

## Usage

To run verification manually:

```bash
# Trigger via GitHub Actions UI (workflow_dispatch)
# Or use gh CLI:
gh workflow run verify.yml --ref main

# To verify specific tag:
gh workflow run verify.yml -f verify_tag=v1.0.0

# To enable strict mode (fail if signatures missing):
gh workflow run verify.yml -f strict_mode=true
```

## Evidence Trail

All verification logs are:
- Uploaded as GitHub Actions artifacts (90-day retention)
- Committed to repository on successful release verification
- Referenced in operational_hash/HASHES.txt
- Linked in core/src/orchestration/sot.md

## Task Reference

- **Task**: SUPPLY-VERIFY
- **Owner**: @platform
- **Dependencies**: SUPPLY-SIGN
- **Acceptance Criteria**: CI verifies signatures/hashes for all releases
- **Evidence**: .github/workflows/verify.yml, TEST/verify/*.log
