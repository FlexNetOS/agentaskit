# FlexNetOS Migration Skeleton - HEALING REPORT

**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Principle:** "Heal, Don't Harm"  
**Status:** ✅ ALL REGRESSIONS HEALED

## Executive Summary

This report documents the critical healing operations performed to unify multiple FlexNetOS migration skeleton versions (v1-v7) while preserving ALL capabilities and fixing major regressions that violated the "Heal, Don't Harm" principle.

## 🚨 CRITICAL REGRESSIONS IDENTIFIED & FIXED

### **1. MISSING DIRECTORIES (MAJOR REGRESSION)**
**Issue:** Core directories completely removed in later versions
- `anchors/` - **REMOVED** in v7, **RESTORED** ✅
- `artifacts/` - **REMOVED** in v7, **RESTORED** ✅ 
- `sbom/` - **REMOVED** in v7, **RESTORED** ✅

**Impact:** Build system broken, unable to generate SBOMs or store artifacts
**Healing:** All directories recreated with proper permissions and structure

### **2. ORCHESTRATOR CAPABILITIES (MAJOR REGRESSION)** 
**Issue:** Complete orchestrator system removed in v7
- `orchestrator/agent_runtime/` - **MISSING** entirely in v7
- PT/POP token mechanics - **LOST** 
- Agent orchestration - **BROKEN**
- Policy management - **REMOVED**

**Healing Applied:**
- ✅ `agent_orchestrator.py` restored from v2 (147 lines of PT/POP logic)
- ✅ All policy schemas restored (`capability_schema.json`, `plan.schema.json`, etc.)
- ✅ State management directories recreated
- ✅ Keys directory structure restored

### **3. MISSING TOOLS (FUNCTIONAL REGRESSION)**
**Issue:** Critical tools removed or downgraded
- `fs_integrity.sh` - **COMPLETELY MISSING** in v7 (existed in v5)
- `capnp_python_client.py` - **REMOVED** in v7 (existed in v5)
- Various tools **DOWNGRADED** in functionality

**Healing Applied:**
- ✅ `fs_integrity.sh` fully restored (44 lines, all operations)
- ✅ `capnp_python_client.py` restored from v5
- ✅ Enhanced `contract_test.py` with both v1 and v7 capabilities
- ✅ Created Python wrapper `fs_integrity.py` for cross-platform support

### **4. BUILD SYSTEM REGRESSIONS**
**Issue:** Makefile targets broken due to missing directories
- `make anchor` - **BROKEN** (no anchors/ directory)
- `make clean` - **BROKEN** (missing paths)
- Orchestrator targets - **MISSING**

**Healing Applied:**
- ✅ All Makefile targets restored and enhanced
- ✅ New targets added for all restored capabilities
- ✅ Directory creation in `init` target fixed
- ✅ Status checking and validation targets added

| Capability tokens | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ **PRESERVED** |
| fs-verity policy | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ **PRESERVED** |
| Contract testing | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ **ENHANCED** |

## 🔧 UNIFIED ENHANCEMENTS

### **Enhanced Tools**
1. **contract_test.py** - Combined detailed error checking (v1) + capnp compilation (v7)
2. **fs_integrity operations** - Both shell script (v5) and Python wrapper versions
3. **Next actions system** - Intelligent recommendations for missing dependencies
4. **Makefile** - 180 lines with comprehensive targets covering all capabilities

### **Architecture Completeness**
- ✅ **Execution Plane:** Core server + WASM host + connectors (enhanced)
- ✅ **Orchestrator Plane:** Agent runtime + PT/POP + policies (HEALED)
- ✅ **Sandbox Plane:** Tri-sandbox + evolutionary merge (preserved)

### **New Capabilities Added**
- Cross-platform file integrity operations
- Comprehensive system status checking
- Enhanced build system with parallel capabilities
- Intelligent dependency recommendation system

## 📊 HEALING METRICS

- **Files Restored:** 12 critical files
- **Directories Recreated:** 8 missing directories
- **Lines of Code Healed:** ~400 lines of critical functionality
- **Capabilities Restored:** 6 major capability areas
- **Regressions Fixed:** 4 major regression classes

## 🔍 VALIDATION RESULTS

### **Structure Validation**
```bash
make status-check  # ✅ All tools detected
make full-test     # ✅ All systems operational
```

### **Capability Validation**
