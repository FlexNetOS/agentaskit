### 4.2 Enhanced Agent System

The current agent system will be extended with:

1. **AI-Powered Agents**: Agents that use LLMs for decision making
2. **Tool-Calling Agents**: Agents that can dynamically invoke external tools
3. **Autonomous Agents**: Self-directing agents that can modify their own behavior
4. **Composite Agents**: Agents that orchestrate other agents

### 4.3 Autonomous Operation Framework

A new autonomous operation framework will be implemented with:

1. **HOOTL Loop**: Continuous autonomous operation cycles
2. **Self-Modification**: Dynamic task and agent generation
3. **Triple Verification**: Enhanced verification protocols
4. **Telemetry**: Comprehensive system monitoring

## 5. Implementation Priority Matrix

| Enhancement | Impact | Effort | Priority | Dependencies |
|-------------|--------|--------|----------|--------------|
| HOOTL Autonomy Loop | High | High | 1 | Telemetry, Enhanced Agents |
| AI-Powered Agents | High | Medium | 2 | AI Integration |
| Telemetry System | Medium | Low | 3 | Database, Metrics |
| Self-Modification Engine | High | High | 4 | HOOTL, Telemetry |

## 6. Technical Considerations

### 6.1 Dependencies

New dependencies will be required:

- `tokio-rusqlite` or `sqlx`: Database operations
- `reqwest`: HTTP client for AI APIs
- `serde_yaml`: Configuration management
- `uuid`: Unique identifiers
- `chrono`: Enhanced time handling
- `tracing`: Advanced logging

### 6.2 Security and Safety

- All AI integrations must respect the existing permit system
- Self-modification capabilities must be sandboxed
- Autonomous operations must have safety limits and kill switches
- All external API calls must be optional and configurable

### 6.3 Performance

- Autonomous loops must be efficient and non-blocking
- Telemetry must have minimal performance impact
- AI operations should be async and cancellable
- Database operations should be optimized for high-frequency writes
