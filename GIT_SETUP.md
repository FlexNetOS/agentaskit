# Git Repository Setup Guide

## üîß Setting Up Remote Repository

### Step 1: Create Repository on Git Platform

Choose your preferred Git hosting platform and create a new repository:

#### GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Click "New repository"
3. Repository name: `agentaskit`
4. Description: "Unified Multi-Agent Operating System - Production Ready"
5. Set to Public or Private as needed
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

#### GitLab
1. Go to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com)
2. Click "New project" ‚Üí "Create blank project"
3. Project name: `agentaskit`
4. Description: "Unified Multi-Agent Operating System - Production Ready"
5. Visibility Level: Public or Private
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README
7. Click "Create project"

### Step 2: Add Remote and Push

Once you have created the repository, copy the repository URL and run these commands:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME and choose your platform)
# For GitHub:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agentaskit.git

# For GitLab:
git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agentaskit.git

# For SSH (if you have SSH keys set up):
# git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/agentaskit.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push to the remote repository
git push -u origin main

# Future pushes can be done with just:
git push
```

### Step 3: Verify Repository

After pushing, verify that your repository is properly set up:

1. Check that all files are visible on the web interface
2. Verify the README.md displays correctly
3. Confirm all 341 files and 184,004+ lines were uploaded
4. Check that the repository structure matches the local structure

### Step 4: Clone/Pull Commands

Once the repository is set up, others can access it with:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agentaskit.git

# Or for SSH:
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/agentaskit.git

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main
```
