## Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Python Features → Rust
1. **SoT Parser**: Port `planner.py` logic to Rust
2. **Task Execution**: Implement parallel task runner
3. **Agent System**: Create agent trait and registry
4. **CLI Interface**: Add clap-based CLI

### Phase 2: Enhanced Rust Features
1. **Effect Integration**: Merge effect system with agents
2. **Security Layer**: Add permit checking to agents
3. **Resource Management**: Implement budget tracking
4. **Type Safety**: Leverage Rust's type system

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. **Configuration**: JSON-based config system
2. **Evidence System**: Structured logging
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types
4. **Testing**: Unit and integration tests

## Recommended Upgrade Path

### 1. Preserve Rust Strengths
- Keep effect system architecture
- Maintain capability security model
- Preserve type safety benefits

### 2. Add Python Functionality
- Implement SoT parsing with regex
- Add parallel task execution
- Create agent registry system
- Build CLI interface

### 3. Hybrid Architecture
```rust
// New proposed structure

├── crates/
│   ├── abi/           # Existing - data structures
│   ├── kernel/        # Enhanced - effect + agent systems
│   ├── effects-*/     # Existing - capability-secure effects
│   ├── planner/       # New - SoT parsing
│   ├── executor/      # New - parallel execution
│   ├── agents/        # New - agent registry
│   ├── cli/           # New - command interface
│   └── runner/        # Enhanced - orchestration
```
