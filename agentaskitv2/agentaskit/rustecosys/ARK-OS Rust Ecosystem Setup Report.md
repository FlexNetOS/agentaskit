## ARK-OS Rust Ecosystem Setup Report

This document summarizes the setup of the Rust ecosystem within the `ark_os_noa` project. The goal was to integrate a wide range of components into a buildable Cargo workspace. While core components have been successfully integrated, several others have been stubbed out due to complex build and dependency issues that could not be resolved in the current environment. The workspace is in a stable, buildable state.

### 1. Project Structure

A Cargo workspace has been established in the `ark_os_noa` directory. It includes the following crates:

```
ark_os_noa/
├── Cargo.toml
├── crates/
│   ├── core
│   ├── axum-api
│   ├── tauri-app
│   ├── rustpython-example (stubbed)
│   ├── pyo3-bindings (stubbed)
│   ├── candle-ml (stubbed)
│   ├── burn-training (stubbed)
│   ├── rig-orchestration (stubbed)
│   ├── qdrant-client (stubbed)
│   ├── postgres-client (stubbed)
│   └── redis-client (stubbed)
└── scripts/
    ├── build.sh
    ├── test.sh
    └── smoke.sh
```

### 2. Integrated Components

The following components have been successfully integrated and are functional:

*   **Cargo Workspace**: The root `Cargo.toml` aggregates all crates as workspace members.
*   **Axum API Service**: A simple API service is available in the `axum-api` crate. It exposes a `/health` endpoint.
*   **Tauri Desktop App**: A minimal desktop application is scaffolded in the `tauri-app` crate. It is wired to the Rust backend, but most of the backend functionality is currently provided by stubs.

### 3. Stubbed Components

Due to persistent build failures, dependency conflicts (`rand`, `pyo3`), and linking errors (`-lpython3.11`), the following components have been replaced with stub implementations. These stubs ensure that the workspace compiles (`cargo check --workspace` passes) while providing a clear path for future integration work. Each stub implements the `ArkComponent` trait with a healthy status.

*   **RustPython & PyO3**: The `rustpython-example` and `pyo3-bindings` crates were stubbed after facing persistent linker errors for the Python 3.11 library, even after installing the development headers.
*   **Candle & Burn**: The `candle-ml` and `burn-training` crates were stubbed due to deep dependency conflicts with other crates in the workspace (specifically the `rand` crate).
*   **Rig**: The `rig-orchestration` crate was stubbed for simplicity, as it depends on other components that are currently stubbed.
*   **Qdrant, PostgreSQL, Redis**: The database client crates (`qdrant-client`, `postgres-client`, `redis-client`) were stubbed after encountering API compatibility issues and build errors that could not be resolved quickly.

### 4. Build & Test Scripts

Scripts are provided in the `ark_os_noa/scripts/` directory to manage the workspace:

*   `build.sh`: Compiles the entire Cargo workspace.
*   `test.sh`: Checks the workspace for errors and runs tests in `no-run` mode.
*   `smoke.sh`: Runs a quick smoke test to ensure the main application components are runnable.

### 5. How to Run

To build and test the project, run the provided scripts from the `ark_os_noa` directory:

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Run the main setup script (builds and tests)
./scripts/setup.sh

# Run the smoke test to verify runtime execution
./scripts/smoke.sh
```

### 6. TODOs & Next Steps

The primary task remaining is to replace the stubbed implementations with functional code. This will involve resolving the dependency and linking issues encountered during this setup process. Specific areas to address:

1.  **Resolve Linker Issues**: Investigate the `pyo3` and `rustpython` linking errors. This may require setting `RUSTFLAGS` or using a `build.rs` script to specify the path to the Python library.
2.  **Fix Dependency Conflicts**: Address the `rand` crate version conflict between the ML crates (Candle, Burn) and other dependencies.
3.  **Update Database Clients**: Update the code in the `qdrant-client`, `postgres-client`, and `redis-client` crates to match the APIs of the latest versions of their respective libraries.
4.  **Implement Full Functionality**: Once the stubs are replaced, implement the example logic for each component as originally intended.
